Approach Explanation for Challenge 1B
Our approach for the Persona-Driven Document Intelligence challenge is a highly efficient, two-stage system. It builds directly on the structured data from Challenge 1A to deliver semantically relevant content to a user based on their specific role and goals. The entire process is designed for speed and accuracy while adhering to all offline and CPU-only constraints.

Stage 1: Consuming Structured Document Data
The foundation of our Challenge 1B solution is the structured JSON file generated by our Challenge 1A process. Instead of re-analyzing the raw PDF, our system ingests this clean, hierarchical data, which has already segmented the documents into logical sections (headings, paragraphs, etc.).

This strategy is crucial for efficiency. By decoupling structural extraction (1A) from semantic analysis (1B), we ensure our system starts with organized, context-rich information, allowing us to focus entirely on understanding the meaning of the content.

Stage 2: Semantic Ranking with Sentence-Transformers
This stage is the core intelligence of our solution. We use the sentence-transformers library with the pre-trained all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to perform a deep semantic analysis. This model was specifically chosen because it is lightweight, highly performant on CPU-only hardware, and operates completely offline, perfectly aligning with the hackathon's constraints.

Our semantic process is as follows:

Persona Vector Creation: We first load the persona.json file for the active collection. The list of interests (e.g., "Create", "Convert", "Edit" or "Breakfast", "Lunch") is consolidated into a single text string. This string is then converted into a high-dimensional vector (an "embedding") that mathematically represents the core intent of the persona.

Document Section Embeddings: We then iterate through every text section from our structured JSON input. For each section, we generate a corresponding vector embedding, capturing its semantic meaning.

Cosine Similarity Scoring: We use Cosine Similarity to calculate the mathematical "distance" between the persona's vector and each section's vector. This score represents how conceptually similar the user's interest is to the content of a given section. A higher score indicates greater relevance.

Ranking and Final Output: The sections are ranked based on their similarity scores, from most to least relevant. This ranked list is then formatted into the final output.json. This semantic approach is powerful because it understands the meaning and intent behind the text, allowing it to find relevant content even if it doesn't contain the exact keywords, ensuring a highly accurate and context-aware result for the user.
